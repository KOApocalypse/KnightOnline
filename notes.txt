===============================================================================
- check into the LOD



- get the EVT system working


- problem with item descriptions getting cutoff
	- they all should fit now but it isn't automatically setting the size
- problem with some item exts being wrong
	- should problem upgrade the structs and copy/paste from 1298
	- this problem is typically detected when the server prevents an item equip
		but the client is OK with it
- fix the UI issues and support 1298 UI
	- this should include rewriting the UIF editor program
- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
- fixed so that it compiles with debug config
	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
- skill descriptions aren't word wrapping
