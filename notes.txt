- be very careful with the "=" operator on GUI components

===============================================================================
- change zoneability back to the 1298 packet
- check Inn hostest packets
- need to work with GetChildByID() and CUISkillTreeDlg class
- work on chat packets


- exp change, and level packets need work
- work on FOG in the camera class
- get "tab" to work on login screen
- issue with starting the binary client after source client
- implement the CUIQuest object for the player quests (UIVarious)
- "Reduce" doesn't seem to be implemented for items
- get colony zone working
	- the zoneability information gets set based on the DB ZoneID
	- will need to update these for all the 1298 zones
- issue where NPCs of opposite nation cannot be interacted with
	- CGameProcMain::OnMouseRBtnPress()
	- server-side "WIZ_ZONEABILITY" packet
	- m_zoneFlags, m_zoneType, m_byTariff, m_byMinLevel, m_byMaxLevel
- there is an issue with the sprint skill. something with cooldown maybe
- skill descriptions aren't word wrapping

	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
