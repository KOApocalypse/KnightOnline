- be very careful with the "=" operator on GUI components

===============================================================================
- work on chat packets


- fix inventory packet
- exp change, and level packets need work
	- strange that some of these only seem to mess up after the failed sprint
		skill?
- fix merchant mode
- change zoneability back to the 1298 packet
- added a HERO format flag for OPD files but I haven't finished anything yet
	- will eventually remove this?
- work on FOG in the camera class
- get "tab" to work on login screen
- issue with starting the binary client after source client
	- this requires starting the binary client before the source version
- why isn't the loading screen texture different?
- need to work with GetChildByID() and CUISkillTreeDlg class
- implement the CUIQuest object for the player quests
	- this will probably require working with the quest packets I was ignoring
		before
- "Reduce" doesn't seem to be implemented for items
- get colony zone working
	- the zoneability information gets set based on the DB ZoneID
	- will need to update these for all the 1298 zones
- issue where NPCs of opposite nation cannot be interacted with
	- CGameProcMain::OnMouseRBtnPress()
	- server-side "WIZ_ZONEABILITY" packet
	- m_zoneFlags, m_zoneType, m_byTariff, m_byMinLevel, m_byMaxLevel
- there is an issue with the sprint skill. something with cooldown maybe
- problem with item descriptions getting cutoff
	- they all should fit now but it isn't automatically setting the size
- skill descriptions aren't word wrapping
- fixed so that it compiles with debug config
	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
