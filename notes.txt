- get the EVT system working
---


- it might be worth trying to manually add an item to the m_QuestNpcList object
	to test this LUA script stuff
- can get the scripts to work. need to add "SendDebugString" which the client
	then prints out in the MsgOut UI


- there is an EVENT class for each map zone
- each of these class contains an array of EVENT_DATA classes
- each "EVENT" -- "END" in the .EVT makes up an EVENT_DATA class
- each EVENT_DATA class had an m_EventNum which is the number following the
	"EVENT" keyword (this m_EventNum is used to index m_arEvent)
- each EVENT_DATA has an array of EXEC classes (the 'E')
- each EVETN_DATA has an array of LOGIC_ELSE classes (the 'A')

- part of the m_EventNum has to do with the NPCs sSid (also is the tbl lookup)
- or it could possible be the sPid... (sSid for depreciated)

- get colony zone working


- problem with item descriptions getting cutoff
	- they all should fit now but it isn't automatically setting the size
- skill descriptions aren't word wrapping
- fix the UI issues and support 1298 UI
	- this should include rewriting the UIF editor program
- fixed so that it compiles with debug config
	- better to wait until I can start with blank new projects
- take a look at the new zone files 1298 added (ens, gev, etc.)
- support all 1068 file formats
	- requires testing of weapons and armor and stuff
